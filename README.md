# HousePricesRegression
maktabkhooneh - Learning machine learning with Python

For this project, we have prepared the information of almost 4000 apartments in Tehran. All data is completely real. Your task is to estimate the price in dollars or tomans using the features of the data set that we have described below. The data is stored in the housePrice.csv file.

There is some information about each house:

- Area in square meters
- Number of bedrooms
- Has Parking or not
- Has elevator or not
- Has warehouse or not
- The region where the house is placed
- Price in Toman and USD
- Notes

Every USD is equal to 30,000 Tomans (Extra Info).

In this dataset, some houses do not have addresses, and also the size of some houses is entered incorrectly (they have a very large value). For this purpose, you should also manage these items and remove them from your dataset.

Take care about outliers & noises.
