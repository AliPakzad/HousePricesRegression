# HousePricesRegression
maktabkhooneh - Learning machine learning with Python

For this project, we have prepared the information of almost 4000 apartments in Tehran. All data is completely real. Your task is to estimate the price in dollars or tomans using the features of the data set that we have described below. The data is stored in the housePrice.csv file.

House size in meters (Area)
Number of bedrooms
Is there a parking lot or not?
Does it have a warehouse or not?
Does it have an elevator or not?
An approximate address in Tehran (Address)
Price in Tomans
Price in dollars (Price(USD))


In this dataset, some houses do not have addresses, and also the size of some houses is entered incorrectly (they have a very large value). For this purpose, you should also manage these items and remove them from your dataset.
